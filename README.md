# Introduction

This project is a boilerplate for building a Node.js backend using TypeScript and Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that makes it easy to interact with a database.

# Getting started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js, TypeScript, and a database management system (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) installed on your machine. You should also have a local copy of the codebase for this project.

Once you have these dependencies installed and set up, you can follow the steps below to get the backend up and running:

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.

Run npm install to install all of the necessary dependencies for the project.

Create a new database and configure the database connection settings in the config/config.json file.

Run sequelize db:migrate to run the database migrations and set up the required tables in the database.

# Usage

`yarn dev`

`yarn seed`

At this point, the backend should be up and running and ready to handle requests from the frontend of your application.

This project is set up with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that can improve the maintainability and scalability of your codebase.
